                I am a writer and strategist based in NYC, dedicated to precise documentation and creative expression. My interest in the human's
                role and condition have cemented my personal passion for philosophy. 
                The question of what makes a philosopher a *philosopher*, and what makes
                a poet a *poet*, is one I have stopped asking.

                <li><strong>✍️ Writing:</strong> I write for work and on my own. 
                Writing is where time stands still. The subject leans toward humanity
                on the brink, and how exciting that we always seem to be.</li>
                <li><strong>🖨️ Making:</strong> I am working on building more opportunities to connect with others, to seek out new perspectives. And, I'm also looking for the best wallpaper for my 19th centurty schoolhouse. (I think I found it!)</li>
                <li><strong>🇯🇵 Learning:</strong> Mostly about AI, these days (see tab on AI top hits. I also would like to learn a bit of Japanese before our trip in April. And I've learned way too much about what's on Apple TV, HBO MAX, and Netflix over the past few weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>🏡 Living:</strong> I co-parent a teenager. This has been a journey which I am always happy to share. I've navigated schooling in NYC and work hard to keep my family life central to everything. My career is also incredibly important, since it seems to be the only other place where I can have an impact. Still figuring it out.</li>
