                I am a writer and strategist based in NYC, dedicated to precise documentation and creative expression. My interest in the human's
                role and condition have cemented my personal passion for philosophy. 
                The question of what makes a philosopher a <i>philosopher</i>, and what makes
                a poet a <i>poet</i>, is one I have stopped asking.

                <li><strong>✍️ Writing:</strong> Writing is where time stands still. I blend my two passions of writing and technology in my job. My current focus is educational program on how AI transforms how we lead, work, and live.</li>
                <li><strong>🖨️ Making:</strong> I am tinkering with AI and wanna build cool stuff on my 3D printer this year. I'm always trying to make my homes better. Should I really do the wallpaper?</li>
                <li><strong>🇯🇵 Learning:</strong> AI, philosophy, and maybe a bit of Japanese before our trip in April.</li>
                <li><strong>🏡 Living:</strong> I co-parent a teenager. This has been a journey which I am always happy to share. I've navigated schooling in NYC and work hard to keep my family life central to everything. My career is also incredibly important, since it seems to be the only other place where I can have an impact. Still figuring it out.</li>
