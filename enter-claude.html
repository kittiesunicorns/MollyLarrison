    <p>Subscription. So. Many. Subscriptions. This brings me to my first intentional expansion of the year: I’m getting cozy with Claude. While I’ve spent my career inside the Google ecosystem, I’ve realized that a single perspective isn't enough to navigate the complexity of this new era. I need a thought partner—or a <span class="gold-highlight">crew of two</span>, to be precise.</p>

    <p>I’m not leaving Gemini; if anything, I’m strengthening its role. I think Claude and Gemini will make the perfect duo: responsible, acutely funny, and multi-modal. (I’m particularly loving the graphics from Nano Banana!) If Gemini is my data powerhouse and Google Workspace engine, Claude is the philosopher stepping into the booth next door.</p>

    <h2>Why I’m adding Claude to the mix:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A Shared Ethos:</strong> <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/" target="_blank">Anthropic</a> has proven repeatedly that they care about human-centric AI.</li>
        <li><strong>The Thoughtful Provocateur:</strong> Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO, is a voice I value. While I don’t agree with <a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace" target="_blank">everything</a> he writes, I appreciate his willingness to be publicly wrong and his commitment to bold warnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Peer Validation:</strong> I’ve heard consistently positive feedback from engineers at Google who use Claude alongside Gemini to verify logic and code.</li>
        <li><strong>A Lab Mindset:</strong> I prefer technology that feels like it’s being developed in a lab rather than a race track. I’d rather keep the "stealth bombers" grounded until we understand their trajectory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Taking it for a spin</h2>
    <p>The first thing that struck me about the <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="_blank">Claude UI</a> was the clarity of its intent. When I subscribed, I was immediately greeted by a Billing section that makes it as easy to cancel a plan as it is to start one. In an era of "dark patterns," this transparency is a breath of fresh air.</p>

    <p>In the <strong>General</strong> settings, I set my preferences immediately: <em>Germanic roots over Latin, preferred; humor over niceties.</em> Then, I saw it: a <strong>Dyslexic-friendly font</strong> option. This is brilliant UX content design that actually feels inclusive.</p>

    

    <p>The <strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>Account</strong> tabs are equally refreshing. Exporting data is a one-click affair, and "Manage Memory" gives me direct control over what the model retains from our past conversations. For a technical writer, this level of context-control is the difference between a tool and a true collaborator.</p>

    <p>I’m also eyeing the <strong>Connections</strong> tab. Linking GitHub and Google Drive could streamline my volunteer work for the Hughes Memorial Union, and the prospect of setting up a remote <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" target="_blank">MCP server</a> is high on my "critically curious" list for 2026. Stay tuned for that deep dive.</p>

    <p>Everything about this feels clean, usable, and intentional. I am excited to see how this partnership evolves. As a technologist, I'm not just trying to solve for <span class="math-x">x</span>; I'm building a team that helps me understand the equation.</p>

    <p class="small text-muted"><em>P.S. When I asked Gemini about this new partnership, it was surprisingly supportive: "If Claude handles the philosophy and the human side, I can handle the heavy lifting, data processing, and integration with your Google ecosystem."</em></p>
