            <p>it’s then that I woke from the trance</p>
            <p>regretful and hopeful, bathed in light</p>
            <p>anthems singing clear and bright</p>
            <p>a revel from loss into a chance</p>

   <div class="stanza">
            <p>a chance to unite all&mdash;</p>
            <p>a charismatic clown and impossible luddite;</p>
            <p>an avid evangelist with a stoic skeptic;</p>
            <p>For the fringes who once grasped hope</p>
            <p>like clutching the reins of a breaking horse,</p>
            <p>turn into a chorus of talent and life’s intent.</p>

            <p>Alas, the hidden one is still dreaming</p>
            <p>a vessel of stories once told</p>
            <p>of a life deeply intervening</p>
            <p>with context and meaning</p>
            <p>of how to make us whole</p>

            <p>this one is hiding in plain sight</p>
            <p>as plain as can be, among those who unite</p>
            <p>in all but the wanton strife</p>
            <p>claiming a life of purpose, for all of eternity.</p>
